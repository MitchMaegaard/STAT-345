Write a function `generate_data(n, p)` which returns a list with the following elements: `covariates` which is a n-by-p matrix of draws from the standard normal distribution, and `responses` which is a vector of length n of draws from the standard normal.

```{r}
generate_data <- function(n, p){
  # create an nXp matrix of draws from N(0,1)
  covariates <- matrix(data = rnorm(n*p, 0, 1), nrow = n, ncol = p)
  # create a vector of length n of draws from N(0,1)
  responses <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)
  # return a list with the elements we created
  return(list(covariates, responses))
}
```
